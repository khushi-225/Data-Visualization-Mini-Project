Airline Performance Analysis
 - This project is about a Dash web application that analyzes airline performance data using interactive visualizations. It allows us to explore and visualize various aspects of airline operations, such as flight cancellations, delays, and performance metrics across different airlines and time periods.

Features
 - Interactive visualizations for airline performance data
 - Yearly Airline Performance Report
    - Monthly flight cancellations by reason
    - Average monthly flight time by airline
    - Percentage of flights by reporting airline
    - Number of flights from origin state (choropleth map)
    - Flight count by airline to destination state (treemap)
 - Yearly Airline Delay Report
    - Average carrier delay time by airline
    - Average weather delay time by airline
    - Average NAS delay time by airline
    - Average security delay time by airline
    - Average late aircraft delay time by airline

Prerequisites
 - Before running the application, these dependencies need to be installed:
    - Python 3.x
    - Pandas
    - Dash
    - Plotly

Data
 - The application uses the airline performance data from the IBM Data Asset Exchange. The data is loaded directly from a URL within the code.
